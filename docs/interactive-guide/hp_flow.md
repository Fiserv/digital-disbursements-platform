# Hosted Page Flow

## Step 1: Create a Recipient

Recipient is a end user who can gets the disbursement money in their accounts provided.

We have two types of recipients.

1. Consumer

2. Business

This request will create a recipient for card vaulting or payment purposes. The recipient can be either business or consumer depends on the merchant use case.
Create recipient is always the first step that needs to be taken to for any transactions or calls on the system. In this step you will register the recipient in our system with the unique identifier (i.e `merchantCustomerId` .)

### Optional/Info: Update Recipient Info

This request will update the previously created recipient with the necessary information. This recipient is identified by the passed in `merchantCustomerId` in the url. Updates the specified recipient by setting the values of the parameters passed. Any parameters not provided will be left unchanged.
The minimal request can be any single entity that requires updating, any of the objects or entities in the parameters of the create recipient schema will work here.

[![Try it out](../../../../assets/images/button.png)](../api/?type=patch&path=/ddp/v1/recipients/{merchantCustomerId})

### Optional/Info: Get Recipient Info

This request will retrieve the information for a recipient based upon its valid `merchantCustomerId` passed in the URL. With this retrieve call you can get the detailed information of the previously created recipient.

## Step 2: Save a Payment Method

<!-- theme: success -->
> **Note**
>
>PayPal, Venmo, eCheck and TA Token payment methods Account vault is not required, can do the disbursements directly.

There are following steps require to save (vault) a payment method for the recipient.

 1. Create a Public Token
 2. Create the Account Nonce Token (API or Hosted)
 3. Vault the payment method

### Step 2a: Create a Public Token

This request will generate a public key to be used in encrypting PCI data as well as a `tokenId` to be passed to subsequent calls through the header. This `tokenId` and the `publicKey` is valid for 20 minutes and after than its expired, you will use the public Key to perform encryption  on the account details as follow:

**Note:** please replace /ddp with /uCom in the context path.

| Account Type | Items to Encrypt             |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Debit        | Card Number, Month, and Date |
| ACH          | Account Number               |
| Coinbase     | Account Number               |
| MoneyNetwork | Card Number                  |

>| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
>| **fdCustomerId**       | How the customer is identified in the uCom app. Best practice would be to use the same value as `merchantCustomerId`.                                                                 |

### Step 2b: Create the Account Nonce Token Using Hosted Payment Page (HPP)

Hosted Payment Page (HPP) is a web SDK and iFrame solution. DDP is intended to provide merchants with an option to capture the cardholder data in secure manner through HPP. Secure card capture allows merchants to embed the HPP SDK into their existing website/web view. This solution will load an iFrame and comply the PCI requirements. In addition to the core functionality of HPP, it is also customizable to match your unique website styling.

#### Components  

Hosted Pages has 4 main Components, the Mobile Application, the Mobile Application Server, Hosted Page and the Connected Commerce (uCom) Sever/API.  

<center><img src="assets/images/HostedPages (1).jpeg" alt="HP Diagram" class="center"></center>

1. **Mobile Application (App)** - This could be a native mobile application running on IOS or Android devices. This could also be a web application running on a browser.

2. **Mobile Application Server (MAS)** - This is a server which is a communication bridge between the App and Connected Commerce (uCom). It also stores Connected Commerce (uCom) developer account information like app id, app secret, and encryption key securely.

3. **Hosted Page (HP)** - This is a web page rendered on native webview or browser which will display the UI to let user enter their account information like Credit card, debit card, gift card etc. This page securely captures the account information from user and passes it to Connected Commerce (uCom) server. When finished, the page sends the result to redirectUrl.

4. **Connected Commerce (uCom) Server** - This is the Fiserv solution server which provides all the APIs. This server sits behind Apigee.

#### Integration Prerequisites

The following parameters are needed to access the Hosted Pages:

| Parameter| Description|
|---|---|
| **Api Key**  | This will be generated for you when you create an Apigee account. This should be saved securely on MAS and shared with App. Api-key is fixed for a merchant.|
| **Api Secret**  | This will be generated for you when you create an Apigee account. This should be saved securely on the application server. This should NOT be shared with app. Api-key is fixed for a merchant. |
| **Redirect Url/MAS Url (Asynchronous)** | All the Hosted pages responses(error/success) will be responded back to JavaScript main return callback only. Responses should be parsed and handled from JavaScript callback. Additionally same responses will be delivered to your MAS URL by Hosted pages via HTTP POST (Ajax Call) asynchronously. This API should be provided by MAS. MAS has to enable CORS for Fiserv origin “int.api.firstdata.com", "cat.api.firstdata.com", and "prod.api.firstdata.com”. This can be used for auditing purposes when a web browser or an app crash accidentally.|
| **FDCustomerId**  | This must be obtained using other Connected Commerce (uCom) apis. This is optional when you initiate SDK with guest checkout option. |
| **PageLink (url and relation)** | This is the unique page which is going to display the use case. Url is the address where page is hosted, and Relation is the name of the use case. PageLink can be retrieved run time via the api (ucom/v1/hosted - pages/pages) and can be cached. We prefer that PageLink should be freshly fetched. The page contents are configured offline. |

#### Steps to Integrate Hosted Pages

##### Architecture Flow

<center><img src="/assets/images/HostedPages (2).png" alt="HP Diagram" class="center"></center>

##### Step 1: Start a New Session  

App calls MAS to get a token ID, encryption Key and page Link. token ID and encryption Key should not be cached or stored on the app and should be fetched from MAS. The token ID and encryption Key expires after 20 minutes and therefore this step should be done every time user starts the flow.

<center><img src="/assets/images/HostedPages (3).png" alt="HP Diagram" class="center"></center>

##### Step 2: App calls MAS

The api between app and MAS is not part of this document. It’s up to the merchant to decide this part of the transaction.

##### Step 3: MAS calls Connected Commerce (uCom) to Get Token

MAS has to call Connected Commerce (uCom) to get a tokenId. MAS should not cache the tokenId. The get Token call will provide the one time session token and public key which needs to be passed to the SDK to launch Hosted Pages.

[Click here for instructions on Creating Security Access Token](../../ConnectedCommerce/api/?type=post&path=/v1/tokens)

##### Step 4: MAS calls Connected Commerce (uCom) to get page link

MAS can cache the page link for future reference to ensure better performance. Merchant may have configured multiple pages and therefore this api will return all of them. Each page can be identified by the relation.

**Endpoint URL**
<https://int.api.firstdata.com/ucom/v1/hosted-pages/pages>

HTTP Method: GET

**Headers**
Content-Type = application/json

Authorization = Bearer {{tokenId}}

Api-Key = {api-key}

Timestamp = {time UTC in milliseconds}

Sample Response:

```json

{
    "_links": [
        {
            "href": "https://int.api.firstdata.com/ucom/v1/hostedpages/pages/f74237ec-112a-4204-a37b-2cfe9daa904f",
            "rel": " account.add",
            "method": "GET",
            "version": "v2"
        }
    ]
}

```

##### Step 5: Load Hosted Page

There are two ways to load hosted Pages: Webview  or iFrame.To start the hosted page, the app needs the api-key, pageLink, tokenId, fdCustomerId, encryptionKey and redirectUrl. Please ensure that the Mobile app has disabled webview caching and enabled loading javascript in webview.

###### Mobile Webview Integration Steps

<details>
<summary><b>A) Load the URL in WebView.</b></summary>

CAT: <https://int.api.firstdata.com/ucom/v2/static/v2/mobile/int/ucom-sdk.html>

PRE-PROD: <https://cat.api.firstdata.com/ucom/v2/static/v2/mobile/cat/ucomsdk.html>

PROD: <https://prod.api.firstdata.com/ucom/v2/static/v2/mobile/prod/ucomsdk.html>

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>B) Call ucomClient.init() javascript method after WebView is loaded with configuration objects.</b></summary>

```javascript

ComClient.init({
   "accessToken": "<token-id>>",
   "apiKey": "<API-key>",
   //If guest checkout then do not pass fdCustomerId 
   "fdCustomerId": "<fdCustomerId>",
   //Get it from pageLink 
   "pageId": "<page-id>>",
   "encryptionKey": "<Encryption-Key>",
   "redirectUrl": "<MAS-URL>"
});

```

>Note: Please refer to the **SDK Configuration Property Values** section for additional params.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>C) Set local redirection listener.<b/></summary>

A redirection listener should be set on the webview to catch the event that Hosted Pages has finished its work. Hosted Pages will call this redirection in case of permanent failures and final success(nonce). A permanent failure is if js fails to load or Ajax call fails or tokenId has expired or encryptionKey invalid.

Once Hosted Pages get response from Connected Commerce (uCom) then it will do URL redirect with encoded URI.

**Redirection Listener URL:** ucom://finish?response=response-payload-object-string

>***Note:** Webview redirection listener URL should be decoded before handle it.*

###### Handle POST from Hosted Pages

>Once Hosted Pages is finished, it will send the result app callback URL and redirectUrl (POST URL). MAS must implement this api to receive the result body. MAS will have to enable CORS on their end to allow access from javascript originating from “int.api.firstdata.com" and "prod.api.firstdata.com”.

</details>
## Events

>Please note that this section is applicable for both Hosted Page implementations: webview and iFrame.

The only way to communicate with Hosted Pages is by listening to an event. Hosted Pages will emit and communicate back if you are subscribed with those events.

```code
          
ucomSDK.on(event, handler);   
          
```

1. **onReady**

    Triggered when iFrame is fully rendered and can accept user’s inputs.

    ```code
            
    ucomSDK.on('ready', function () { //Handle ready event
    });
            
    ```

2. **onChange**

    Triggered when form value is changed. The event payload always contains object with form valid status.

    ```code
            
    ucomSDK.on('change', function () {
    if (event.formValid) {
        //Enable pay button
    } else {
        //Disable pay button
    }
    });          

    ```

    Handler Event Object

    ```code
    {
    "elementType": "payment",
    "formValid": false
    }
            
    ```

3. **onError**

    Triggered when the Hosted Pages API has errors. The event payload object contains API error which needs to be handled on app.

    ```code
            
    ucomSDK.on('error', function (response) { //Handle Error Response
    });
    ```

4. **onSuccess**

    Triggered when Hosted Pages generates a nonce. The event payload object contains nonce which needs to be handled on app.

    ```code
            
    ucomSDK.on('success', function (response) { //Handle Nonce 
    });
            
    ```

#### API Error Status Codes

Below error status code needs to be handled from client side. These API error responses will be communicated back to App JavaScript main callback to handle the errors and show the appropriate error dialog.

##### Error Responses Before Screen Renders

Following errors will be thrown before hosted pages screen render.

| Status Code     | Transaction Status Desc | Comments |
|----------------|-------------------|----------- |
| 269904    | Configuration record(s) not found.       | When an invalid page id is passed, then the API will throw this error     |
| 401    | Unauthorized       | This error will occur when when an invalid access token id is passed.     |

###### Example Response Payload

```json

{
    "response": {
        "code": "269904",
        "message": "Configuration record(s) not found.",

            "developerMessage": "Unauthorized"
        }
    }
}
          
```

###### Error Responses After Form Submission

Following errors will be thrown after hosted pages screen render

| Status Code     | Transaction Status Desc | Comments |
|----------------|-------------------|----------- |
| 279912    | Decryption failed.        | When we pass an invalid or an already used public key into SDK then API will throw this error.     |
| 269901    | Unable to process your request, please try again later, if problem persist, contact sys admin.       | This error occurs when a communications problem occurs between the frontend and backend.    |
| 401    | Access Token expired or Unauthorized       | This error will occur when user idle and try to submit the rendered form with expired access token.     |

        }
    }
}
          
```

#### Native/Web Submit Button

If needed, Hosted Pages has the ability to submit the form through the mobile app native button or website button from outside the iFrame. Following command will trigger the save action:

```code

ucomSDK.triggerSaveAction(); 

```

>Please note: this has to be triggered from outside the iFrame or web view.

---

### Step 2c: Vault a Payment Method

This request will take our generated nonce token from previous step in the payload as well as the `tokenId` from Step 1 in the headers. Once this step is completed the payment method will be vaulted and an EV (Enrollment Vault) token will be generated. These tokens are specific to payment methods vaulted with Fiserv and are not to be confused with TA (TransArmor) tokens which are generated through other flows. This EV token can be non-expired tokens and can be used multiple times for that recipient.

>**Header Change**
>
>| Header Key | Change |
>| ---------- | ------ |
>| Authorization | returns to normal HMAC signature |
>| access_token  | the same `tokenId` used in the Bearer authorization in step 3 (*ex.* `access_token: AGG596cV67WF8DjYLE3kS6nSu36x`) |

<!-- This is a Special API I don't Think we should call this out in the Interactive guide. -Jay
### Get Recipient Accounts

This request will retrieve the account information based on the recipientId. This will return ALL associated payment methods with this `recipientId`. Remember the `recipientId` changes based upon email so if multiple merchantCustomerIds share the same email this will pull all the accounts from every merchantCustomerId associated with that email.

### Step 3a:  Cancel a Payment

This feature is to cancel a payment transaction which is in progress or waiting for settlement. This is applicable for any ACH,Coinbase,Venmo(incase of unclaimed) and PayPal(incase of unclaimed) transaction which is waiting for settlement. The prerequisite is to have a transaction initiated or disbursed using the payment API. The parameter required is the transaction id or TID [this is the unique id generated by DDP and is mapped 1:1 against the merchant transaction id].

Using `merchantCustomerId`: This request can be used when you want to view all the transactions for that merchant customer id  

[![Try it out](../../../../assets/images/button.png)](../api/?type=patch&path=/ddp/v1/payments/{merchantTransactionId}/cancel)

Using `merchantTransactionId`: This request to be used when you want to view the details of a particular transactions

[![Try it out](../../../../assets/images/button.png)](../api/?type=patch&path=/ddp/v1/payments/{transactionId}/cancel)

### Step 3b: Get Transaction Status

This request will get the details of a transaction and will take either `merchantCustomerId` or 'merchantTransactionId' in the request parameter. The prerequisite is to have a transaction initiated or disbursed using the payment API. Please refer transaction initiate/disburse section in the following link for more information.

Using `merchantCustomerId`: This request can be used when you want to view all the transactions for that merchant customer id  

[![Try it out](../../../../assets/images/button.png)](../api/?type=get&path=/ddp/v1/transactions/recipients/{merchantCustomerId})

Using `merchantTransactionId`: This request to be used when you want to view the details of a particular transactions

[![Try it out](../../../../assets/images/button.png)](../api/?type=get&path=/ddp/v1/transactions/{transactionId})

## Step 4: Optional/Info: Get Merchant Info

This request will get the details of an on boarded merchant with no request parameter only the headers are required. With this call you can get the full information of the merchant like ledger balance, Available balance, DFA Account Number, Merchant Name & Address details etc.
