## Step 1: Create a Recipient

Recipient is a end user who can gets the disbursement money in their accounts provided.

We have two types of recipients.

1. Consumer

2. Business

This request will create a recipient for card vaulting or payment purposes. The recipient can be either business or consumer depends on the merchant use case.
Create recipient is always the first step that needs to be taken to for any transactions or calls on the system. In this step you will register the recipient in our system with the unique identifier (i.e `merchantCustomerId` .)

### Optional/Info: Update Recipient Info

This request will update the previously created recipient with the necessary information. This recipient is identified by the passed in `merchantCustomerId` in the url. Updates the specified recipient by setting the values of the parameters passed. Any parameters not provided will be left unchanged.
The minimal request can be any single entity that requires updating, any of the objects or entities in the parameters of the create recipient schema will work here.

### Optional/Info: Get Recipient Info

This request will retrieve the information for a recipient based upon its valid `merchantCustomerId` passed in the URL. With this retrieve call you can get the detailed information of the previously created recipient.

## Step 2: Save a Payment Method

<!-- theme: success -->
> **Note**
>
>PayPal, Venmo, eCheck and TA Token payment methods Account vault is not required, can do the disbursements directly.

There are following steps require to save (vault) a payment method for the recipient.

 1. Create a Public Token
 2. Create the Account Nonce Token (API or Hosted)
 3. Vault the payment method

### Step 2a: Create a Public Token

This request will generate a public key to be used in encrypting PCI data as well as a `tokenId` to be passed to subsequent calls through the header. This `tokenId` and the `publicKey` is valid for 20 minutes and after than its expired, you will use the public Key to perform encryption  on the account details as follow:

**Note:** please replace /ddp with /uCom in the context path.

| Account Type | Items to Encrypt             |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Debit        | Card Number, Month, and Date |
| ACH          | Account Number               |
| Coinbase     | Account Number               |
| MoneyNetwork | Card Number                  |

>| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
>| **fdCustomerId**       | How the customer is identified in the uCom app. Best practice would be to use the same value as `merchantCustomerId`.                                                                 |

### Step 2b: Create the Account Nonce Token

<!--
type: tab
titles: API, Hosted 
-->

In this request you are going to encrypt your PCI (Payment Card Industry) data with the help of `publicKey` and `tokenId` generated in "Create a Public Token" API call in previous step. Once that is done you will pass that data into this call and receive a nonce token to be used in the upcoming step for account vaulting. Keep in mind the encrypted payload for each variable should be surrounded by `ENC[ ]` as shown in the examples.

**Note:** please replace /ddp with /uCom in the context path

HPP is a web SDK and iFrame solution. DDP is intended to provide merchants with an option to capture the cardholder data in secure manner through HPP. Secure card capture is to allow merchants to embed the HP SDK into their existing website/web view. This SDK solution offered by DDP platform shall load in iFrame and comply the PCI requirements. In addition to the core functionality of HPP, It shall provide a capability to customize the UI to match the merchant's website style.

### Step 2c: Vault a Payment Method

This request will take our generated nonce token from previous step in the payload as well as the `tokenId` from Step 1 in the headers. Once this step is completed the payment method will be vaulted and an EV (Enrollment Vault) token will be generated. These tokens are specific to payment methods vaulted with Fiserv and are not to be confused with TA (TransArmor) tokens which are generated through other flows. This EV token can be non-expired tokens and can be used multiple times for that recipient.

<!-- This is a Special API I don't Think we should call this out in the Interactive guide. -Jay
### Get Recipient Accounts

This request will retrieve the account information based on the recipientId. This will return ALL associated payment methods with this `recipientId`. Remember the `recipientId` changes based upon email so if multiple merchantCustomerIds share the same email this will pull all the accounts from every merchantCustomerId associated with that email.

This feature is to cancel a payment transaction which is in progress or waiting for settlement. This is applicable for any ACH,Coinbase,Venmo(incase of unclaimed) and PayPal(incase of unclaimed) transaction which is waiting for settlement. The prerequisite is to have a transaction initiated or disbursed using the payment API. The parameter required is the transaction id or TID [this is the unique id generated by DDP and is mapped 1:1 against the merchant transaction id].

Using `merchantCustomerId`: This request can be used when you want to view all the transactions for that merchant customer id
