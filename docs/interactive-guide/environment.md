# Environment Set-up

This is the preruisite set up for access to Fiserv API's. In this Guide we will cover how to generate specific headers, required endpoints, and show some example setups you can leverage to get up and running quickly.

## Connectivity

The DDP services are accessed through the public Internet. DDP accepts communication only via the HTTPS channel.  Custom HTTP headers are also used carry additional information in each request.

| Environment       | Host                           | Base Path |
| ----------------  | ------------------------------ | --------- |
| Integration Test  | <https://int.api.firstdata.com>  | /ddp      |
| Production        | <https://prod.api.firstdata.com> | /ddp      |

## Header Description

The header of Each API call will contain several parameters. It is important that each parameter contain the specified values to have a successful API Call. Any changes to the values will be noted through out the guide.

### HTTP Headers

| Header Name | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Api-Key | Yes | Merchant API key |
| Timestamp | Yes | Request initiation UTC timestamp, formatted as Epoch time. The value is in milliseconds. Sample value format is 1499961987232 |
| Authorization | Yes | Authorization header is required to have the "HMAC" string capitalized and followed by one space followed by the calculated hmac signature. For request generated through Server: Authorization: - HMAC <signature>.   "HMAC " followed by the Encrypted payload as signature, shown below  |
| Client-Request-Id | Yes | Contains a unique ID generated by the client that is used for enforcing idempotence on POST actions. |
| Content-Type | Yes | application/json |
| access\_token | Conditionally | Required when vaulting payment information. Utilizes the tokenId returned from the /tokens api. |

### Sample Header

```JSON
"Content-Type":"application/json"
"Client-Request-Id":"4da61bfb-6852-4f2a-9462-733276f633d7"
"Api-Key": "YMgw8VSrYMG6WTIUnoUUGv7hF9Aqh3EO"
"Authorization" : "HMAC W5X9NAlPgSNsfQX55fXbXrk3arzL6KxcCTA6SrnxL+U="
"Timestamp": "1607368688646"
```

### How to generate HMAC Signature

#### Description

HMAC signature is used in all calls made to our API and is necessary to receive a successful response from the system.

#### High Level Flow

- Get and save the current time
- Identify and save the request method
- Take the environment key and append a colon along with the current time
- Save this as the current raw signature (key:time)
- Get and save the payload from the request
- If the request method is not POST, move directly to step 7.
- Encrypt the request payload using SHA256 and save it
- Take this encrypted payload, make it a string and then encrypt it using Base64.
- Take the raw signature from step 4, append a colon and the Base64 encrypted payload to it and save it.
- Take the raw signature and HMAC encrypt it using SHA256 against the environment secret.
- Finally take this encrypted raw signature, make it a string and then encrypt it using Base64 to produce the signature for the header.

```javaScript

var key = postman.getEnvironmentVariable('clientKey');
var secret = postman.getEnvironmentVariable('clientSecret');
var time = new Date().getTime();
var method = request.method;
var rawSignature = key + ":" + time;
var requestBody = request.data;

if (method != 'GET' && method != 'DELETE') {
    var payload_digest = CryptoJS.SHA256(requestBody);
    var b64BodyContent = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(payload_digest);
    rawSignature = rawSignature + ":" + b64BodyContent;
}

var signature = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(rawSignature, secret);
postman.setEnvironmentVariable('time', time);
postman.setEnvironmentVariable('signature', CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(signature));

```
