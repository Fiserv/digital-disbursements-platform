# Introduction

This guide documents the Batch as used by the Digital Payout product. The Batch allows to client initiate and manage large numbers of payments through an easy-to-use through csv files. Merchant places files in Fiserv hosted SFTP Location. DDP polls the SFTP locations for further processing.

• Merchant should upload files to SFTP location with below file name pattern. Each segment is separated by dot (.)

• FLXPI{FLEX_MID}.{TYPE}.{EPOCH}.{NAME}.{VERSION}.csv; Sample File name : FLXPINMM.CI.1654537809.BAT97.1.csv

The below table identifies the parameters of File format.

| Variable   | Description                | Ex    |
| --------  | ----------------------------------------------------------------------| ------- |
| `FLXPI`   | Constant                |      |
| `FLEX_MID` | Alpha Numeric Flex MID provided to merchant at the time of onboarding. max-length = 3  | SF,NMM  |
| `TYPE`   | 2 letter record type  CI Create Recipient & Initiate Payment, IP Initiate Payment, CP Cancel Payment, CR Create Recipient, UR Update Recipient                 | CI   |
| `EPOCH`  | number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT) | 1654537809 |
| `NAME`  | merchant preferred alpha-numeric (label or name) max-length : 20   | STLMNT220510 batch93 |
| `VERSION`  | file version as integer.             | 1    |
| `EXT`   | file extension              | CI   |

**How Merchant Sends files to SFTP ?**

INBOUND FDFG moves files from MERCHANT's mail-box to SFTP '/available/' directory with file-name <INBOUND_JOB_ID><FILE_NAME>

OUTBOUND FDFG moves files from SFTP '/' directory with file-name <OUTBOUND_JOB_ID><FILE_NAME> to MERCHANT mail-box with <OUTBOUND_JOB_ID><FILE_NAME>

Both JOB_IDs should be different; Ex : INBOUD `FLXPI<MID>`   OUTBOUND `FLXPO<MID>`

## Inbound file

CI Create Recipient & Initiate Payment file should have comma separated fields in specific order.

Each field should be quoted with double-quotes (") for data reliability.  

Refer below table for DDP CSV Fields

## Outbound file

• DDP exports a batch summary report - containing status of each input file record, success/failure, error-description if failed.

Ex: If merchant submits an inbound file with 100 records then outbound file should have 100 entries and their response info.

• Outbound file name will be in FLXPO{FLEX_MID}.{TYPE}.{EPOCH}.{NAME}.{VERSION}_Summary.csv format.

 Ex : If inbound file is FLXPINMM.CI.1654537809.BAT97.1.csv then. outbound file will be FLXPONMM.CI.1654537809.BAT97.1.csv_Summary.csv

### Outbound file Mapping Details

Response file contains multiple records. Each field in a record is separated by pipe (|) delimiter. find the below record format.

CI|MERCHANT_ID|MERCHANT_CUSTOMER_ID|MERCHANT_TRANSACTION_ID|STATUS_CODE|STATUS_DESCRIPTION

| Field Name     | Comments                |
